* Overview

This collection of shamefully scrappy scripts do two main things:

1. Run different SSH agents for different keys, so that a compromised agent
   has only limited use (eg: root on client A's hosts can't use it access
   client B's hosts).

2. Require ssh-agent to prompt for confirmation before it uses a key, so that
   a compromised agent stands less chance of being exploited (if the user
   is away or declines the request then nothing happens).

The scripts are hopefully Bourne-shell pure, although it's possible some
BASH-isms might've crept in. The Growl and the playsound bits are OS X shaped.

There's doubtless room for improvement here. This grew over time to scratch
successive itches, and trades grace and style for getting stuff done!

* Operation

Shells source ssh-agent-env.rc in their profile. This defines two functions:

1. load_agent_env

  For a named key, this will either create a new agent for it, loading the
  key as it goes, or merely recover the environment of an existing agent. 

  The create/load work is pushed to a script, create-ssh-agent-for-key.sh

2. kill_agent

  Kills the agent of a named key

  It also defines two shell aliases, la for load_agent_env, and xsh for
  ssh-with-lookup.rb. More on that later.

The main scripts are:

1. create-ssh-agent-for-key.sh

  This script goes off to look for a SSH key whose path is derived from its
  name.  For me, this is /Volumes/key/ssh/id_dsa-${KEYNAME}.
   
  It then creates a new SSH agent and stores its environment details in a
  dotfile specific to this key, ~/.ssh/.ssh-agent-${KEYNAME}.

  Whilst doing so it uses the ${SSH_ASKPASS} variable to indicate to ssh-agent
  that it should run this variable's command before passing a key's deatils
  along. Keys that want such behaviour are then loaded into the agent with
  ssh-add -c.

2. ssh-askpass.sh

  This is the program run by ssh-agent when it's asked to provide a key. It
  alerts the user to an incoming agent request and waits for confirmation.

  To decouple the user interaction from the SSH process it compares two files'
  timestamps: one from when the request came in, and one updated by the
  out-of-band confirmation process.

  It plays an annoying sound at intervals to alert the user to the request, and
  they can decide whether or not they were expecting the request.

  The script exits zero to indicate confirmation, or non-zero to decline the
  request.

3. ssh-agent-auth.sh

  This is other side of the confirmation process. The script merely update the
  timestamp of one of the files ssh-askpass.sh is looking at. Typically it's run
  by a keyboard shortcut. (Hello FastScripts)

4. ssh-decline.sh

  This script drops a file marker to indicate to ssh-askpass.sh that its should
  not agree to the agent request. Again, can be run from a keyboard shortcut.

5. ssh-with-lookup.rb

  This script wrappers a SSH invocation, setting up the necessary environment
  for the key's agent and providing a mechanism to fully qualify a hostname
  based on defaults and overrides.

6. clear-agent.sh

  Removes the dotfiles relating to managed agents and any timestamp files. It
  doesn't actually kill the agents. It probably should.

7. ssh-growl.rb

  Trivial Growl wrapper for ssh-askpass.sh to use to produce Growl notifications.

8. ssh-defeat.sh

  Drop off a marker file that disables confirmation prompting for a given key.

9. ssh-agent-lock.rb

  Not part of this stuff, but a proof-of-concept agent lock/unlock script.
  See inside for more details.

* Example

Quick demo to unabstractificate this stuff:

1. Create a new agent for the lemon-zomo key:

  $ load_agent_env lemon-zomo
  No agent loaded for lemon-zomo
  Agent pid 23919
  Enter passphrase for /Volumes/key/ssh/id_dsa-lemon-zomo: 
  Identity added: /Volumes/key/ssh/id_dsa-lemon-zomo (/Volumes/key/ssh/id_dsa-lemon-zomo)
  The user has to confirm each use of the key
  Agent pid 23919
  
  $ ssh-add -l
  1024 5d:b9:a6:ca:00:01:f2:f4:93:18:83:da:85:b2:a1:7e /Volumes/key/ssh/id_dsa-lemon-zomo (DSA)
  
2. Create another agent for another key, using the shell alias la:

  $ la 732
  No agent loaded for 732
  Agent pid 25129
  Enter passphrase for /Volumes/key/ssh/id_dsa-732: 
  Identity added: /Volumes/key/ssh/id_dsa-732 (/Volumes/key/ssh/id_dsa-732)
  The user has to confirm each use of the key
  Agent pid 25129

  $ ssh-add -l
  1024 1a:6b:2b:28:9b:fd:59:d8:61:af:9e:0e:18:db:02:2e /Volumes/key/ssh/id_dsa-732 (DSA)

3. In a new shell, use ssh-with-lookup.rb, via xsh shell alias, to SSH somewhere:

  $ ssh-add -l
  The agent has no identities. # This is OS X's default agent

  $ xsh hq.zomo
  ssh -l lemon hq.zomo.co.uk 
  Last login: Wed Aug 11 13:12:33 2010 from somewhere.example.com

Various things now happen:

  . ssh-with-lookup.rb recovered the agent details
  . it appended the zomo.co.uk domain and user account switch and invoked ssh
  . the agent was asked to key the connection
  . the agent ran ssh-askpass.sh 
  . ssh-askpass.sh didn't exit until I confirmed it
  . which I did by pressing a keyboard shortcut that ran ssh-agent-auth.sh

As suggested this is all quick and dirty hacks. No claims made about its
fitness for use, no warranty or anything like that. It may indeed eat children
and melt ice caps. Good luck.
